# USOPC-Data-Challenge

data_2017_2021.csv and data_2022_2023.csv are the CSV files provided for us at the start of the Data Challenge.

main.py is our py file which cleans the data, creates the graphs, and runs the linear regression. It outputs two teams
    for both Mens and Womens. One team is the team that maximizes the score, and the other is the team that maximizes
    the adjusted score.
